# EvoFlow benchmarking


## Running the benchmark

Because it is not possible to enable/disable GPU after initialization, each run
of the benchmark must be done separatly using the following command:

`python run_benchmark.py backend`

Results are saved under 'results/'.

### submitting results

If you are willing to commit your results (thanks!) then make sure to
name your results files appropriately following this pattern:
`githubname/version_gpu_os_date_plateform.json`
